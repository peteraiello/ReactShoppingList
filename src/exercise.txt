ok we're going to make a shopping list
you have an input and the text gets added to an unordered list of fruits


1. Create a component of ShoppingListInput and a component for ShoppingListOutput
2. The input is just an input. The output is an unordered list with one or two pieces of fruit (for now)
3. Add a prop for an item of fruit ('bananna'). 
4. Add a state for the item of fruit. Remember useState and setState
5. Add an eventHandler to add an item of fruit to input
6. Bind this as a new item to the ShoppingListOutput component
7. Style as appropriate.
